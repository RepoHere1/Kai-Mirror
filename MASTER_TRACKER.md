## [OK] WHAT'S BUILT & WORKING (HARD INFRASTRUCTURE)

### **Operator Law - Hard-Coded & Enforced**
| Location | Enforcement |
|----------|-------------|
| `server.js:1767-1768` (DRY) / `1829-1830` (LIVE) | Boot: `OPERATOR_LAW.assertNoSupervisor()` + `enforce('boot')` |
| `server.js:1342` (DRY) / `1402` (LIVE) | Toggle endpoint: only writer of `ls.running` |
| `server.js:573` (DRY) / `660` (LIVE) | Engine tick: mid-tick stop is absolute |
| Global `OPERATOR_LAW` object | Forbidden patterns: `supervisor`, `auto.start`, `auto.restart`, `keep.alive`, `watchdog`, `resurrect`, `reenable` |

**Result:** Button push = immediate absolute law. No supervisor, no auto-start, no auto-restart, no resurrection. Lane stays exactly as operator set it forever.

### **Single-Button Toggle (Both Dashboards)**
- Buttons: `<button id="btn-{name}" onclick="toggleStrategy('{name}')">Stop</button>`
- `paintNow()` paints intent instantly -> fetch -> server applies synchronously -> returns `{law: "OPERATOR_LAW_ENFORCED"}`
- On failure: reverts button, logs error to trade feed
- Verified: `curl` toggles return `running: true/false` + `law: "OPERATOR_LAW_ENFORCED"`

### **Bulk ON/OFF via Scripts**
```powershell
# DRY
.\kai.ps1 on    # starts all 9 lanes
.\kai.ps1 off   # stops all 9 lanes

# LIVE
.\kai-live.ps1 on
.\kai-live.ps1 off
```
Persists to `state.json` - survives server restart.

### **ALL NO MARKETS Engine (Both Servers)**
| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `runAllNoEngine()` | Every 10s: scans `noBook()`, auto-enters top-K by edge (Kelly-sized, maker at bid) |
| `runAllNoExits()` | Every 5s: monitors open positions, exits on TP/SL/time-decay |
| `noBook()` | Returns NO-side recommendations with real BS fair value, edge, Kelly |
| `createAllNoEntry()` / `closeAllNoPosition()` | Entry/exit with balance tracking |
| `postAllNoOrder()` | LIVE mode: posts real Kalshi NO-side orders |

**Config (`ALL_NO_CONFIG`):**
```javascript
{
  scan_interval_ms: 10000,
  max_concurrent: 10,
  max_exposure_pct: 0.3,
  kelly_cap: 0.4,
  min_edge: 0.001,
  min_vol: 0.00005,
  max_gap: 0.015,
  maker_only: true,
  trail_pct: 0.5,
  max_hold_pct: 0.8,
  stop_loss_pct: 0.25,
  take_profit_mult: 2,
}
```

### **Lane Engine Upgrades (Both Servers)**
| Feature | Code Location |
|---------|---------------|
| Maker entry (use bid not ask) | `engineTick` line 628 (DRY) / 629 (LIVE) |
| Kelly sizing check | `engineTick` line 640-641 |
| Portfolio heat limit (30% max exposure) | `engineTick` line 636-638 |
| Regime filter (skip wide_spread, arbitrage) | `engineTick` line 622-624 |
| Max hold time (5 min default) | `engineTick` line 651-654 |
| Mid-tick operator stop guard | `engineTick` line 573 / 660 |
| **Trailing stops (50% profit lock)** | `engineTick` line 1156 (DRY) / 1026 (LIVE) |
| **Time-decay exit (80% tau)** | `engineTick` line 1149 (DRY) / 1019 (LIVE) |

### **Brain (Ensemble Signals) - 12 SIGNALS ACTIVE**
**Base 6 Signals (both `brain_dry.js` & `brain_live.js`):**
1. **Arbitrage** - risk-free when YES+NO < 1.0 (weight 1.0)
2. **Imbalance** - order book bid/ask size ratio (DRY 0.7 / LIVE 0.85)
3. **Volume** - volume spike momentum (DRY 0.6 / LIVE 0.75)
4. **Cross-Expiry** - per-minute cost across expirations (DRY 0.5 / LIVE 0.55)
5. **Whale** - follow large fills after 30s (DRY 0.3 / LIVE 0.55)
6. **Black-Scholes** - normal CDF fair value (DRY 0.15 / LIVE 0.2)

**Advanced 6 Signals (NEW - High Alpha):**
7. **Order Flow** - bid/ask size ratio + recent fill direction toxicity (DRY 0.65 / LIVE 0.85)
8. **Vol RP** - volatility risk premium: sell high-IV NO when realized < implied (DRY 0.55 / LIVE 0.7)
9. **Term Struct** - term structure arbitrage across expirations using BS fair (DRY 0.45 / LIVE 0.65)
10. **Funding Carry** - crypto carry: forward = spot * exp(r*tau) vs Kalshi price (DRY 0.5 / LIVE 0.6)
11. **Correlation Hedge** - portfolio heat: reduce size when BTC+ETH both signal same side (meta-signal)
12. **Settlement Alpha** - CF BRTI 60s TWAP vs Coinbase spot at settlement (DRY 0.7 / LIVE 0.8, final hour only)

**LIVE weights** emphasize real-time signals; de-emphasize slow/noisy ones.

### **Real BS Fair Value (Replaces 0.5 Prior)**
`noBook()` lines 1025-1030 (DRY) / 1080-1085 (LIVE):
```javascript
if (sp && Number.isFinite(sp.price) && q.strike != null && q.close_time) {
  const perSec = perSecondVol(lane.spot, 900);
  const tau = Math.max(0, (new Date(q.close_time).getTime() - Date.now()) / 1000);
  if (perSec && tau > 20) fair = 1 - normCdf(Math.log(sp.price / q.strike) / (perSec * Math.sqrt(tau)));
}
```

### **Kalshi WebSocket (Real-Time Data)**
- `kalshi_ws.js` in both folders - WebSocket client for markets/fills/orders
- Auto-reconnect, heartbeat, authentication
- Connected in `boot()` - subscribes to all lane series + fills + orders
- Updates `marketCache` with `source: 'ws'` for sub-second freshness

### **Coinbase WebSocket (Real-Time Spot) - NEW**
- `coinbase_ws.js` in both folders - HMAC-authenticated WebSocket client
- Channels: `ticker` for BTC-USD, ETH-USD, XRP-USD, HYPE-USD
- Connected in `boot()` - updates `spot` object in real-time
- Replaces 2s HTTP polling with sub-second spot prices

### **Runtime Config (Both Servers)**
```javascript
runtime: {
  clip: 5,
  min_edge: 0.001,
  max_price: 0.90,
  min_price: 0.05,
  take_profit: 0.90,
  stop_loss: 0.25,
  kelly_cap: 0.4,
  min_hold_sec: 30,
  entry_cooldown_sec: 60,
  max_hold_sec: 300,
  max_exposure_pct: 0.3,
  maker_only: true,
}
```

### **Dashboard Monitoring Panels (6 Panels) - NEW**
| Panel | Metrics | Endpoint |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Edge decay curve | edge at entry vs edge at exit per trade | `/api/monitoring` |
| Regime win rate | Win % by regime (arbitrage, high_vol, normal, etc.) | `/api/monitoring` |
| Signal attribution | Win % per signal source | `/api/monitoring` |
| Kelly efficiency | actual_return / kelly_return per trade | `/api/monitoring` |
| Execution quality | (fill - bid) / (ask - bid) - should be <= 0 for maker | `/api/monitoring` |
| ALL NO heatmap | Edge vs tau vs fair 3D surface | `/api/monitoring` |

### **Data Pipeline Upgrades - NEW**
| Upgrade | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Options chain cache | `fetchOptionsChain(series)` - full chain per series (20 depths), 5s TTL |
| Settlement database | `state.settlement_db` - CF BRTI 60s TWAP proxy (Coinbase spot at settlement) |
| Fill quality tracker | `state.fill_quality_db` - tracks `(fill - bid) / (ask - bid)` at entry, maker <= 0 |

### **API Enhancements - NEW**
- **Rate limiting:** 120 req/min per IP (in-memory, skips health/static)
- **Webhooks:** CRUD at `/api/webhooks`, HMAC-signed payloads, fires on `trade_exit`

### **Railway Deployment Ready - NEW**
| Item | DRY (8787) | LIVE (8788) |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Dockerfile | [OK] | [OK] |
| railway.json | [OK] | [OK] |
| Health check endpoint | [OK] `/api/health` | [OK] `/api/health` |
| Docker HEALTHCHECK | [OK] | [OK] |

### **Dashboard Buttons**
- All 9 lanes: `<button id="btn-{name}" onclick="toggleStrategy('{name}')">Stop</button>`
- `paintCards()` updates button text from snapshot (`Stop`/`Start`)
- Debug logging removed - clean production code

---

## * IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (NEW PRIORITIES)

### **1. Kalshi WebSocket Stabilization**
- Kalshi WS repeatedly disconnects (code 1006) - likely auth/permission issue
- Need to verify Kalshi WebSocket API permissions for market data channels

### **2. Performance Optimizations**
- DB indexing for trades/positions queries
- Connection pooling for Kalshi HTTP client
- Caching layer for frequently accessed endpoints

### **3. Testing & Validation**
- Unit tests for brain signals
- Integration tests for engine tick
- Backtesting framework for strategy validation

### **4. New Trading Strategies**
- Additional signal generators (funding rate arb, basis trading)
- Multi-venue arbitrage (Kalshi vs other prediction markets)
- Options Greeks-based signals

### **5. Operational Improvements**
- Structured logging (JSON) for observability
- Metrics export (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Alerting on critical failures

## 2026-11-03 THE REAL REASON FOR THE LOSSES: THE MODEL WAS SELLING A FAKE EDGE

Calibration of claimed fair vs ACTUAL Kalshi settlement (LIVE trades):
  claimed fair 0.50-0.55  n=11  actual win 36.4%  (model 15 pts overconfident)
  claimed fair 0.55-0.60  n=8   actual win  0.0%  (pure fiction)
  claimed fair 0.60-0.65  n=13  actual win 69.2%  (honest)
  claimed fair 0.65-0.70  n=60  actual win 61.7%  (honest)
  claimed fair 0.70-0.80  n=38  actual win 71.1%  (honest)
The cheap entries on the tape (in=0.39 fair=0.55) live in the zone where the
gaussian digital model is demonstrably wrong. min_fair 0.58 let them through.

P&L BY PRICE PAID (settled trades, LIVE's real fee 1.15c/contract, held to settle):
  p<.40    n=19  win 21.1% vs 31.5% breakeven -> -$25.69   <- ALL OF THE LOSS
  .40-.50  n=16  win 50.0% vs 46.3%            ->  +$5.19
  .50-.60  n=39  win 71.8% vs 55.4%            -> +$43.99
  .60-.70  n=5   win 80.0% vs 61.1%            ->  +$5.66
LIVE lifetime -$29.46; the sub-40c population alone was -$25.69 of it.
Everything bought above 45c has been positive.

GATE CHOSEN BY COUNTERFACTUAL (hold-to-settle, real fees, LIVE history):
  NOW  .45/.65 fair>=.58 edge<=.18  n=70  win 67.1%  +$47.78
  G    .50/.70 fair>=.62 edge<=.30  n=85  win 70.6%  +$61.28   <- APPLIED
Applied via POST /api/config (RUNTIME - lives in state.json, not git):
  min_entry_price 0.50, max_no_price 0.70, max_yes_price 0.70,
  min_fair 0.62, max_edge 0.30, brain_max_price 0.70

WHY DRY LOOKED PROFITABLE WHILE LIVE LOST - two structural lies in the lab:
  1) FEES. DRY booked 1.75% of exit proceeds only (avg 0.60c/contract). LIVE
     actually pays 1.15c/contract; Kalshi's rule is 0.07*p*(1-p) per contract
     on BOTH legs. FIXED in Kai-Mirror (entry + exit legs, real formula).
  2) FILL REALISM. The paper book credits every resting bid as filled. Real
     post-only bids fill mostly on adverse moves - which is why LIVE's cheap
     entries won 21% while DRY's won 51% in the SAME band. NOT modelled yet;
     it is the next honesty fix for the lab.

STATUS: LIVE gate live (floor .50 caps .70 fair .62), 0 open positions,
crash.log witnessing on both servers (it recorded DRY's 04:09 restart).
n=85 is still small - this gate is evidence-backed, not a promise.
## Addendum 2026-11-03 late: fill_sim is LIVE in the lab, with corrections

- /api/fill-realism reports intents, filled, unfilled, fill_rate, adverse_pct,
  avg_wait_ms; counters persist in state.fill_realism. Logs: sim_intent,
  sim_fill (with adverse flag and the print that hit us), sim_unfilled (reason).
- Crossing direction is side-aware because Kalshi prints in YES cents: a YES bid
  fills on a print <= our level; a NO bid fills on a print >= 1 - our level.
  (My first version had this backwards and produced a fake 0% fill rate.)
- A volume baseline is taken on the intent's FIRST observed quote, so a fill can
  never be proved by volume that already existed when the intent was created.
- First measurement under the corrected rule: 6 intents, 1 fill, and that fill
  was ADVERSE (100%) - the bid was hit because the market had moved through us.
- Confidence ceiling: LIVE enforces fair 0.62-0.75; DRY leaves the ceiling OFF so
  the lab keeps logging the loud-claim zone that calibration proved is fiction.
- Lab totals are still not evidence: fills are now honest, but queue position is
  still approximated (we assume we were next in line at our level).
## 2026-11-03 CRASH/BOOT ROOT CAUSE FIX (found, fixed, and TESTED - not theory)

What actually killed the servers (the "SERVER DOWN / boots 23 / lanes 0 on" tape):
  1. watchdog.ps1 probed /api/health with a 3 SECOND timeout. A merely SLOW
     server read as DOWN -> kctl restart -> taskkill /F = SIGKILL. SIGKILL runs
     no handler, so there was NO crash.log entry, and it could tear state.json.
  2. save() used a raw writeFileSync, so a kill mid-write left a corrupt file.
  3. loadState() swallowed the parse error and returned defaultState(), so the
     next boot silently ran on DEFAULT risk: 9 lanes -> 0, and the price floor,
     fair floor, clip and exposure cap were all gone. That is "lanes 0 on".
  The watchdog was not saving the machine, it was disarming it.

The permanent fix (both repos, every point verified by test):
  * state.json is written ATOMICALLY (temp -> fsync -> rename); a rolling
    state.backup.json keeps the last known good copy.
  * loadState(): primary -> backup -> FAIL CLOSED. If neither parses, the server
    boots with safe_mode=true, every lane off, and NO trading (LIVE order
    placement is hard-blocked in kalshi.js placeOrderV2), and it says so in
    /api/health (safe_mode, state_source) and in crash.log (BOOT ...).
  * config.json (NEW, version controlled) holds the operator risk gates and is
    overlaid on state at every boot, so a torn or deleted state file can never
    loosen the gates. Edit config.json, commit, restart.
  * POST /api/shutdown flushes state atomically and exits cleanly. kctl.ps1 now
    stops servers GRACEFULLY first and force-kills only as a fallback; it also
    rotates server.log/server.err, because a log still held by a dying process
    silently killed the new child with an empty error log.
  * watchdog.ps1 v2: a TCP REFUSED means down; a LISTENING but slow server is
    alive and is NEVER killed; two consecutive refusals before acting; 5 min
    cooldown; graceful stop. It never touches lane flags.
  * crash.log: every line now carries its PID, the exit handler records the
    STACK that ended the process, and the witness is registered at the very top
    of the module so an early boot failure cannot escape unrecorded.
  * ops/watchdog.ps1 and ops/kctl.ps1 are now in git (they used to live only
    in Temp, where a cleanup would have silently removed the fix).

TESTED by deliberately corrupting state.json: it recovered from the backup with
all 9 lanes and all gates intact (source=backup); with BOTH copies destroyed it
came up in safe_mode with trading blocked (source=none) instead of trading on
defaults - and it stayed up for inspection rather than vanishing.

## 2026-11-03 DATA FACTS LAYER (verdict before action + evidence ledger)

THE LIE IT KILLS: a quote payload is a mash of fields fetched at different
moments - a STATIC REST market record plus a live book that arrives separately
over the WebSocket - and the model then adds a probability on top. When those
pieces disagreed, nothing told the machine, so it traded anyway. Worse, the
stream layer silently fell back to the static REST snapshot whenever the live
tick was older than FRESH_MS: that is how stale prices reached the engine.

THE PERMANENT FIX (both repos):
  * data_facts.js verifies EVERY observation before the machine may act on it,
    and REFUSES it if it fails:
      CONSISTENT  yes_bid + no_ask <= 1+tick and no_bid + yes_ask <= 1+tick.
                  A violation proves the payload mixes two different snapshots.
      PRICED      every price inside the exchange band. Dead ladder strikes
                  (0 / 0.01) are refused, not treated as a 0 price.
      PRINTED     a last print AND a volume must both exist, with the SOURCE
                  recorded: a print off the live tape beats a REST snapshot.
      SPREAD      the touch is neither zero-width nor absurdly wide.
      SKEW        the YES-implied mid and the NO-implied mid must agree.
      FRESH       measured against the LIVE tick, not against the static
                  market record: no live tick for 15s, or an unchanged REST
                  book for over 2 minutes, is stale and refused.
  * quote_stream.js now overlays the LATEST known book even when the tick is
    old (the REST record is static, so the newest tick is strictly better
    information) and stamps live_tick_at / live_print / live_volume onto the
    quote. The real trade-tape print now also reaches q.last, so the fill
    simulator proves fills against tape prints rather than a REST snapshot.
  * The verdict is made AT THE MOMENT OF THE DECISION, on exactly the prices
    that would be traded: the scanner re-applies the live book and re-verifies
    before it considers a market. A verdict computed at fetch time and used
    30s later is not a verdict, it is a rumour.
  * Every observation is written to facts.db with its source, timestamp and
    verdict, so any decision can be replayed later: "what did the machine
    actually know when it clicked?".
  * New endpoints: /api/data-health (verdict counts, refusal reasons, live
    coverage) and /api/facts?minutes=N (the ledger itself).
  * The market-implied probability (the mid of the REAL touch) is exported as
    implied_yes - the only probability that is a fact rather than a model
    output, and the anchor the machine must be measured against.

MEASURED AFTER THE CHANGE: the good facts are all `kalshi:ws` with ages of
0.4-1.6 SECONDS (real live books: BTC 0.72/0.73, ETH 0.66/0.67, XRP
0.60/0.61, HYPE 0.36/0.37 with real volume), while dead ladders, zero-width
books and stale books are refused by name. The engine did not stop trading:
DRY maker intents kept advancing, which is the proof that the gate refuses
BAD data without refusing the good stuff.
