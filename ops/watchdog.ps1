# Kai autonomous watchdog v2 - 2026-11-03 (crash-cause fix)
#
# WHY v2 EXISTS (root cause of the "SERVER DOWN / boots 23 / lanes 0 on" tape):
#   v1 probed /api/health with a 3 SECOND timeout. When the server was merely
#   SLOW (SQLite write, busy event loop), v1 concluded DOWN and ran
#   "kctl restart", which did taskkill /F = SIGKILL. That produced:
#     - no crash.log entry (SIGKILL runs no handler),
#     - a possible TORN state.json (non-atomic save),
#     - the next boot falling back to defaultState(): 9 lanes -> 0, and every
#       risk gate (price floor, fair floor, clip, exposure cap) silently reset.
#   The watchdog was not saving the machine, it was disarming it.
#
# v2 RULES:
#   1. TCP connect REFUSED = genuinely down  -> eligible for restart.
#   2. Port LISTENING      = alive, however slow health is -> NEVER kill it.
#   3. Two consecutive confirmed-down checks before acting (no flapping kills).
#   4. Minimum 5 minutes between restarts of the same server (no restart loop).
#   5. Stop is GRACEFUL: POST /api/shutdown flushes state atomically first;
#      force kill only if the server refuses to exit.
#   6. It NEVER touches lane flags. The operator's button push is law.
